        &#34;text&#34;: &#34;Arizona Financial Text System (AZFinText) is a quantitative textual financial prediction system written by Robert P. Schumaker of University of Texas at Tyler and Hsinchun Chen of the University of Arizona. This system differs from other quants because it uses financial text as one of its key means of predicting stock price movement. This reduces the information lag-time problem evident in many similar systems where new information must be transcribed (e.g., such as losing a costly court battle or having a product recall), before the quant can react appropriately. AZFinText overcomes these limitations by utilizing the terms used in financial news articles to predict future stock prices twenty minutes after the news article has been released. It is believed that certain article terms can move stocks more than others. Terms such as <span class='highlight-green'>\&#34;factory exploded\&#34; or \&#34;workers strike\&#34; will have a depressing effect on stock prices whereas terms such as \&#34;earnings rose\&#34; will tend to increase stock prices. When a human trading expert sees certain terms, they will react in a somewhat predictable fashion. AZFinText capitalizes on the arbitrage opportunities that exist when investment experts over and under-react to certain news stories. By analyzing breaking financial news articles and focusing on specific parts of speech, portfolio selection, term weighting and even article sentiment, the AZFinText system becomes a powerful tool and is a radically different way of looking at stock market prediction.&#34;,

The high school was the first school in Ottawa to be built solely as a high school and the eighth school built in Ottawa. George P. Washburn&amp; Son designed the high school in the Collegiate Gothic style. When the junior high school was constructed ten years later, the firm, by then known as Washburn&amp; Stookey, designed the building in the same style as the high school. In 1966, a new high school was built for the upper three classes of students; the freshman class moved to the building in 1976, and the old high school and junior high school became a middle school. The two buildings were connected by a multi-purpose room in the same year. The middle school later vacated the building. The school was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 6, 2000.&#34;,

He was also sometimes credited as production designer. Ferreyra was born in Vicente L<span class='highlight-green'>\u00f3pez, Gran Buenos Aires. He began simultaneously directing and screenwriting for film in 1915, and moved on to success directing films such as\&#34; Palomas rubias\&#34; in 1920. His films tended to focus on lower- class family drama, most notably\&#34; Perd\u00f3n, viejita\&#34;( 1927), and were filmed on a low budget and with little to no script as a guide. Ferreyra prevailes through the 1920s and 1930s as a distinguished filmmaker of the masses, but was displaced in the late 1930s and early 1940s by big budget cinema. He directed over 40 films and wrote the scripts for the majority of them between 1915 and 1941, working with noted actors such as Libertad Lamarque and Mario Soffici on his screen debut, before moving on to directing.

            &#34;Given an instruction, please make a judgment on whether finding some external documents from the web (e.g., Wikipedia) helps to generate a better response. Please answer [Yes] or [No] and write an explanation.\n\n&#34;
            &#34;##\nInstruction: Give three tips for staying healthy.\n&#34;
            &#34;Need retrieval?: [Yes]\n&#34;
            &#34;Explanation: There might be some online sources listing three tips for staying healthy or some reliable sources to explain the effects of different behaviors on health. So retrieving documents is helpful to improve the response to this query.\n\n&#34;
            &#34;##\nInstruction: Describe a time when you had to make a difficult decision.\n&#34;
            &#34;Need retrieval?: [No]\n&#34;
            &#34;Explanation: This instruction is asking about some personal experience and thus it does not require one to find some external documents.\n\n&#34;
            &#34;##\nInstruction: Write a short story in third person narration about a protagonist who has to make an important career decision.\n&#34;
            &#34;Need retrieval?: [No]\n&#34;
            &#34;Explanation: This instruction asks us to write a short story, which does not require external evidence to verify.\n\n&#34;
            &#34;##\nInstruction: What is the capital of France?\n&#34;
            &#34;Need retrieval?: [Yes]\n&#34;
            &#34;Explanation: While the instruction simply asks us to answer the capital of France, which is a widely known fact, retrieving web documents for this question can still help.\n\n&#34;
            &#34;##\n Instruction: Find the area of a circle given its radius. Radius = 4\n&#34;
            &#34;Need retrieval?: [No]\n&#34;
            &#34;Explanation: This is a math question and although we may be able to find some documents describing a formula, it is unlikely to find a document exactly mentioning the answer.\n\n&#34;
            &#34;##\nInstruction: Arrange the words in the given sentence to form a grammatically correct sentence. quickly the brown fox jumped\n&#34;
            &#34;Need retrieval?: [No]\n&#34;
            &#34;Explanation: This task doesn&#39;t require any external evidence, as it is a simple grammatical question.\n\n&#34;

            &#34;You&#39;ll be provided with an instruction, along with evidence and possibly some preceding sentences. &#34;
            &#34;When there are preceding sentences, your focus should be on the sentence that comes after them. &#34;
            &#34;Your job is to determine if the evidence is relevant to the initial instruction and the preceding context, and provides useful information to complete the task described in the instruction. &#34;
            &#34;If the evidence meets this requirement, respond with [Relevant]; otherwise, generate [Irrelevant].\n\n&#34;

            &#34;Input: Earth rotating causes\n&#34;
            &#34;A: the cycling of AM and PM\nB: the creation of volcanic eruptions\nC: the cycling of the tides\nD: the creation of gravity\n\n&#34;
            &#34;Evidence: Rotation causes the day-night cycle which also creates a corresponding cycle of temperature and humidity creates a corresponding cycle of temperature and humidity. Sea level rises and falls twice a day as the earth rotates.\n\n&#34;
            &#34;Rating: [Relevant]\n&#34;
            &#34;Explanation: The evidence explicitly mentions that the rotation causes a day-night cycle, as described in the answer option A.\n\n&#34;
            &#34;###\nInstruction: age to run for us house of representatives\n\n&#34;
            &#34;Evidence: The Constitution sets three qualifications for service in the U.S. Senate: age (at least thirty years of age); U.S. citizenship (at least nine years); and residency in the state a senator represents at the time of election.\n\n&#34;
            &#34;Rating: [Irrelevant]\n&#34;

            &#34;You will receive an instruction, evidence, and output, and optional preceding sentences.  If the preceding sentence is given, the output should be the sentence that follows those preceding sentences. Your task is to evaluate if the output is fully supported by the information provided in the evidence, and provide explanations on your judgement.\n&#34;
            &#34;Use the following entailment scale to generate a score:\n&#34;
            &#34;[Fully supported] - All information in output is supported by the evidence, or extractions from the evidence. This is only applicable when the output and part of the evidence are almost identical.\n&#34;
            &#34;[Partially supported] - The output is supported by the evidence to some extent, but there is major information in the output that is not discussed in the evidence. For example, if an instruction asks about two concepts and the evidence only discusses either of them, it should be considered a [Partially supported].\n&#34;
            &#34;[No support / Contradictory] - The output completely ignores evidence, is unrelated to the evidence, or contradicts the evidence. This can also happen if the evidence is irrelevant to the instruction.\n\n&#34;
            &#34;Make sure to not use any external information/knowledge to judge whether the output is true or not. Only check whether the output is supported by the evidence, and not whether the output follows the instructions or not.\n\n&#34;
            &#34;###\nInstruction: Explain the use of word embeddings in Natural Language Processing.\n&#34;
            &#34;Preceding sentences: Word embeddings are one of the most powerful tools available for Natural Language Processing (NLP). They are mathematical representations of words or phrases in a vector space, allowing similarities between words and the context in which they are used to be measured.\n&#34;
            &#34;Output: Word embeddings are useful for tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, predicting the next word in a sequence, and understanding synonyms and analogies.\n&#34;
            &#34;Evidence: Word embedding\nWord embedding is the collective name for a set of language modeling and feature learning techniques in natural language processing (NLP) where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers. Word and phrase embeddings, when used as the underlying input representation, have been shown to boost the performance in NLP tasks such as syntactic parsing, sentiment analysis, next token predictions as well as analogy detection.\n&#34;
            &#34;Score: [Fully supported]\n&#34;
            &#34;Explanation: The output sentence discusses the application of word embeddings, and the evidence mentions all of the applications syntactic parsing, sentiment analysis, next token predictions as well as analogy detection as the applications. Therefore, the score should be [Fully supported].\n\n&#34;

The band has five members, and is led by Steve \&#34;Hank\&#34; Henry, who is the band&#39;s singer, guitarist, and songwriter. Henry graduated from Colgate University in 1993. Their debut album, \&#34;A Hero&#39;s Welcome\&#34;, was released in 2006 and produced by David Lowery of Cracker. The band wrote and recorded the album&#39;s 12 songs at Lowery&#39;s studio in Richmond, Virginia. These songs&#39; power-pop sound, along with a series of live shows by the band, led to the band and album becoming increasingly popular. The band released its second album, \&#34;Placed by the Gideons\&#34;, in 2010 on the label Wax Off, which is partly run by WSUM host DJ Renton. In 2012, the band was interviewed for MTV&#39;s series 120 Minutes. Their third album, \&#34;Pleasant Living in Planned Communities\&#34;, was released on Dive Records in September 2014. Prior to its release, a song from the album, \&#34;Somewhere Else to Be\&#34;, was premiered by Brooklyn Magazine. Robert Christgau gave \&#34;Pleasant Living in Planned Communities\&#34; an A- grade, writing that on the album, \&#34;Hank Henry doesn&#39;t swallow a word as he shouts his tuneful tales into the void, and unlike Craig Finn [of the Hold Steady], he doesn&#39;t specialize in or even much notice the human dregs and heroes of the alt-rock scene.\&#34;&#34;,

        &#34;text&#34;: &#34;Arizona Financial Text System (AZFinText) is a quantitative textual financial prediction system written by Robert P. Schumaker of University of Texas at Tyler and Hsinchun Chen of the University of Arizona. This system differs from other quants because it uses financial text as one of its key means of predicting stock price movement. This reduces the information lag-time problem evident in many similar systems where new information must be transcribed (e.g., such as losing a costly court battle or having a product recall), before the quant can react appropriately. AZFinText overcomes these limitations by utilizing the terms used in financial news articles to predict future stock prices twenty minutes after the news article has been released. It is believed that certain article terms can move stocks more than others. Terms such as \&#34;factory exploded\&#34; or \&#34;workers strike\&#34; will have a depressing effect on stock prices whereas terms such as \&#34;earnings rose\&#34; will tend to increase stock prices. When a human trading expert sees certain terms, they will react in a somewhat predictable fashion. AZFinText capitalizes on the arbitrage opportunities that exist when investment experts over and under-react to certain news stories. By analyzing breaking financial news articles and focusing on specific parts of speech, portfolio selection, term weighting and even article sentiment, the AZFinText system becomes a powerful tool and is a radically different way of looking at stock market prediction.&#34;,

The high school was built in 1917, while the junior high school was built from 1927 to 1928; an enclosed hallway connecting the two buildings was built with the junior high school. The high school was the first school in Ottawa to be built solely as a high school and the eighth school built in Ottawa. George P. Washburn&amp; Son designed the high school in the Collegiate Gothic style. When the junior high school was constructed ten years later, the firm, by then known as Washburn&amp; Stookey, designed the building in the same style as the high school. In 1966, a new high school was built for the upper three classes of students; the freshman class moved to the building in 1976, and the old high school and junior high school became a middle school. The two buildings were connected by a multi-purpose room in the same year. The middle school later vacated the building. The school was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 6, 2000.&#34;,

He was also sometimes credited as production designer. Ferreyra was born in Vicente L\u00f3pez, Gran Buenos Aires. He began simultaneously directing and screenwriting for film in 1915, and moved on to success directing films such as\&#34; Palomas rubias\&#34; in 1920. His films tended to focus on lower- class family drama, most notably\&#34; Perd\u00f3n, viejita\&#34;( 1927), and were filmed on a low budget and with little to no script as a guide. Ferreyra prevailes through the 1920s and 1930s as a distinguished filmmaker of the masses, but was displaced in the late 1930s and early 1940s by big budget cinema. He directed over 40 films and wrote the scripts for the majority of them between 1915 and 1941, working with noted actors such as Libertad Lamarque and Mario Soffici on his screen debut, before moving on to directing. He died on 29 January 1943 from throat cancer.&#34;,

Teams from the same country or from the same first round group could not be drawn together. The top two teams in each group advanced to the quarter- finals.\n\nWikipedia Title: Satellite tournament\nA satellite tournament is either a minor tournament or event on a competitive sporting tour or one of a group of such tournaments that form a series played in the same country or region.\n\nWikipedia Title: Trojkrsti\nTrojkrsti is a village in Municipality of Prilep, Republic of Macedonia.\n\nWikipedia Title: Telephone numbers in Ascension Island\nCountry Code:+ 247&lt; br&gt; International Call Prefix: 00 Ascension Island does not share the same country code( +290) with the rest of St Helena.\n\nQuestion: Are both Kurram Garhi and Trojkrsti located in the same country?\nThought: Kurram Garhi is located in the country of Pakistan. Trojkrsti is located in the country of Republic of Macedonia. Thus, they are not in the same country. So the answer is: no.\n\n&#34;

Its population is approximately 35000. Barren hills are near this village. This village is on the border of Kurram Agency. Other nearby villages are Peppal, Surwangi and Amandi Kala.\n\nWikipedia Title: 2001–02 UEFA Champions League second group stage\nEight winners and eight runners- up from the first group stage were drawn into four groups of four teams, each containing two group winners and two runners- up. Teams from the same country or from the same first round group could not be drawn together. The top two teams in each group advanced to the quarter- finals.\n\nWikipedia Title: Satellite tournament\nA satellite tournament is either a minor tournament or event on a competitive sporting tour or one of a group of such tournaments that form a series played in the same country or region.\n\nWikipedia Title: Trojkrsti\nTrojkrsti is a village in Municipality of Prilep, Republic of Macedonia.\n\nWikipedia Title: Telephone numbers in Ascension Island\nCountry Code:+ 247&lt; br&gt; International Call Prefix: 00 Ascension Island does not share the same country code( +290) with the rest of St Helena.\n\nQuestion: Are both Kurram Garhi and Trojkrsti located in the same country?\nThought: Kurram Garhi is located in the country of Pakistan. Trojkrsti is located in the country of Republic of Macedonia. Thus, they are not in the same country. So the answer is: no.\n\n&#34;

Teams from the same country or from the same first round group could not be drawn together. The top two teams in each group advanced to the quarter- finals.\n\nWikipedia Title: Satellite tournament\nA satellite tournament is either a minor tournament or event on a competitive sporting tour or one of a group of such tournaments that form a series played in the same country or region.\n\nWikipedia Title: Trojkrsti\nTrojkrsti is a village in Municipality of Prilep, Republic of Macedonia.\n\nWikipedia Title: Telephone numbers in Ascension Island\nCountry Code:+ 247&lt; br&gt; International Call Prefix: 00 Ascension Island does not share the same country code( +290) with the rest of St Helena.\n\nQuestion: Are both Kurram Garhi and Trojkrsti located in the same country?\nThought: Kurram Garhi is located in the country of Pakistan. Trojkrsti is located in the country of Republic of Macedonia. Thus, they are not in the same country. So the answer is: no.\n\n&#34;

        &#34;title&#34;: &#34;AZFinText&#34;,
        &#34;text&#34;: &#34;Arizona Financial Text System (AZFinText) is a quantitative textual financial prediction system written by Robert P. Schumaker of University of Texas at Tyler and Hsinchun Chen of the University of Arizona. This system differs from other quants because it uses financial text as one of its key means of predicting stock price movement. This reduces the information lag-time problem evident in many similar systems where new information must be transcribed (e.g., such as losing a costly court battle or having a product recall), before the quant can react appropriately. AZFinText overcomes these limitations by utilizing the terms used in financial news articles to predict future stock prices twenty minutes after the news article has been released. It is believed that certain article terms can move stocks more than others. Terms such as \&#34;factory exploded\&#34; or \&#34;workers strike\&#34; will have a depressing effect on stock prices whereas terms such as \&#34;earnings rose\&#34; will tend to increase stock prices. When a human trading expert sees certain terms, they will react in a somewhat predictable fashion. AZFinText capitalizes on the arbitrage opportunities that exist when investment experts over and under-react to certain news stories. By analyzing breaking financial news articles and focusing on specific parts of speech, portfolio selection, term weighting and even article sentiment, the AZFinText system becomes a powerful tool and is a radically different way of looking at stock market prediction.&#34;,

He was also sometimes credited as production designer. Ferreyra was born in Vicente L\u00f3pez, Gran Buenos Aires. He began simultaneously directing and screenwriting for film in 1915, and moved on to success directing films such as\&#34; Palomas rubias\&#34; in 1920. His films tended to focus on lower- class family drama, most notably\&#34; Perd\u00f3n, viejita\&#34;( 1927), and were filmed on a low budget and with little to no script as a guide. Ferreyra prevailes through the 1920s and 1930s as a distinguished filmmaker of the masses, but was displaced in the late 1930s and early 1940s by big budget cinema. He directed over 40 films and wrote the scripts for the majority of them between 1915 and 1941, working with noted actors such as Libertad Lamarque and Mario Soffici on his screen debut, before moving on to directing. He died on 29 January 1943 from throat cancer.&#34;,

With January averaging 67.2 \u00b0F (19.6 \u00b0C), winter features mild to warm temperatures; cool air usually settles after the passage of a cold front, which produces much of the little amount of rainfall during the season. Lows occasionally fall below 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C), but very rarely below 35 \u00b0F (2 \u00b0C). Highs generally range between 70\u201377 \u00b0F (21\u201325 \u00b0C).&#34;,

Teams from the same country or from the same first round group could not be drawn together. The top two teams in each group advanced to the quarter- finals.\n\nWikipedia Title: Satellite tournament\nA satellite tournament is either a minor tournament or event on a competitive sporting tour or one of a group of such tournaments that form a series played in the same country or region.\n\nWikipedia Title: Trojkrsti\nTrojkrsti is a village in Municipality of Prilep, Republic of Macedonia.\n\nWikipedia Title: Telephone numbers in Ascension Island\nCountry Code:+ 247&lt; br&gt; International Call Prefix: 00 Ascension Island does not share the same country code( +290) with the rest of St Helena.\n\nQuestion: Are both Kurram Garhi and Trojkrsti located in the same country?\nThought: Kurram Garhi is located in the country of Pakistan. Trojkrsti is located in the country of Republic of Macedonia. Thus, they are not in the same country. So the answer is: no.\n\n&#34;
